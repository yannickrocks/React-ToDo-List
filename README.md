## React To-Do List app
This was created using standard Javascript. Inside are some react components and some tests.
I have made it responsive and accessible.

To run the application, you can either:
1) Clone the repo locally then use `yarn start`
2) Go to this url [https://yannickrocks.github.io/ReactToDoList](https://yannickrocks.github.io/ReactToDoList)
### `yarn start`
